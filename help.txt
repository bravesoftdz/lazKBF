Kill those bothersome files with KBF.

Finds and kills those bothersome file. Originally written to removed
to wrost offenders - Thumbs.db. I got so fed up with backing up
these files along with all my pictures.

The root folder is chosen and then searched this should produce a
list of files to be killed. If it does the kill button will be enabled.

If a second directory is searched without clearing the files will be
added to the list. This is to enable the removal of files from several
directories at once.


Had a bit of problem with recursively searching the directory tree.
so at the moment a DOS dir command is used. This does cause
A DOS box to appear during searching. This can be ignored - sorry.
