Kill those bothersome files with KBF.

Kill Bothersome Files - kills those bothersome files, that get in the way.

Choose the root directory and the type of bothersome files.
The root directory will then be walked - when the kill button becomes available, kill those little suckers!!!

Direction for use ...

1 ... Select the root directory.
2 ... Select type of files to kill.
3 ... Wait while the directory is walked - can take some time - sorry.
4 ... Select which files to kill [either All, None or individually].
5 ... Kill those bothersome files [see warning below].

The clear button allows a rescan of the chosen directory; say if the choice of files have been altered.
